# pyMarkdownKonverter

This is the idea of a converter from Markdown to LaTex, but also possible to other formats in future. The idea is to read in the markdown and than create a list of objects that represent the elements possible in Markdown. The Elements all share a common interface, due to which they can be rendered to a template.

As the template language jinja2 is planed.
